# Tic Tac Typescript


## What

Player-v-computer-style tic-tac-toe game.

## Where

[Tic-Tac-Typescript on GH Pages](http://www.ihatetoast.com/tic-tac-typescript/)

## Why

Wanted to play around with different ways of checking the game, playing a computer (vs alternating with another human), and, of course, using TypeScript. I find that I like to have a few mini-apps to bang through to focus on little things.

## How

Vite, React, Typescript, cussin


## What if ...

- Make the computer make better choices. Mulling in my head how to make the computer smarter and not just randomly choose from an array of empty cells. Thinking to add a function that is similar to check winner and look for rows/cols/diags that have 2/3 of the other player's symbols and then choose that. But as of this writing, I'm just comparing basic game logic and using Typescript. (Along this thought is another TTT but for Tailwind practice). 
- Animate results. Make CSS more fun since this is mine and not for a company (where I have to obeeey the Figmaaa vs just play)
